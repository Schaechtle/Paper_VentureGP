We provided \gpmem, an elegant linguistic framework for function learning-related tasks such as Bayesian optimization and \ac{GP} kernel structure learning.
We highlighted how \gpmem\ overcomes shortcomings of the notations currently used
in statistics, and how language constructs from programming allow the expression
of models which would be cumbersome (prohibitively so, in some cases) to express
in statistics notation. We evaluated our contribution on a range of hard problems for state-of-the-art Bayesian nonparametrics.
