We have shown Venture GPs. We have introduced novel stochastic processes for a probabilistic programming language. We showed how flexible non-parametric models can be treated in Venture in only a few lines of code. We evaluated our contribution on a range of hard problems for state-of-the-art Bayesian non-parametrics. Venture GPs showed competitive performance in all of them.
