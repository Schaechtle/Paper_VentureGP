Random samples from a \ac{GP}, like all random samples in Venture programs,
are generated with the invocation of \ac{SP}s.
Such \ac{SP}s accept input arguments that are values in Venture and sample output
values given those inputs. A \ac{PSP} is the most basic unit of computation in
Venture. It can be deterministic or random. If a \ac{PSP} is random then it can simulate from a family of
distributions. In addition to simulating,
a random PSPs may be able to report the logdensity of an output given an input.

Different \ac{SP}s and \ac{PSP}s ar used to construct the \ac{GP} interface:
\begin{enumerate}
% this is not how I should tell the story, it should be different,
% 1. maker, 2. it's child, which is a AAA
\item MakeGPOutputPSP is a deterministic PSP whose output is a \ac{GP}, namely the
GPSP, given a
covariance and a mean function as input. Inputting a mean function is optional,
if it is not supplied, it is set to constant 0.

\item GPSP of is type SP. GPSP can \ac{AAA}. \ac{AAA}-\ac{SP}s can keep track of
their outputs and report
the joint logdensity of all of its applications. This is crucial so that we do
not need to visit all of it's absorbing nodes to explicitly to account for their
logdensities. For Venture, the construct of the scaffold can stop upon
reaching an \ac{AAA} node. GPSP is responsible for tracking the the sufficient statisticis
from the applications of GPSP and for evaluating the log density of all those
applications as a block. It also constructs the auxialiary SP.
\item GPSPAux of type SPAux. An SPAux is stateless but comes with an auxilliary
store that carries mutable information. In cae of the \ac{GP} it tracks the
samples that were incorporated.
\item GPOutputPSP of type Random PSP.  It is this SP that actually samples
regression output at given input.
