Random samples from a \ac{GP}, like all random samples in Venture programs,
are generated with the invocation of \ac{SP}s. \ac{SP}s are the basic units of
computation in Venture. They provide a general framework to think about
probabilities that is particularly handy for \ac{GP}s. This framework does not
only define the implementation of a \ac{GP} model and possible inference over it but also
the representation and formulation of a \ac{GP} as a probabilistic model.
This aspect is somewhat different from the view of traditional machine learning,
seeing the software engineering and programming aspects only as a vehicle to
realize and communicate an idea.  In contrast, the language of samplers and \ac{SP}s provide a
different view point to what a \ac{GP} can and cannot compute.

\ac{SP}s in general accept input arguments that are values in Venture and sample output
values given those inputs. They can be deterministic or random. If an \ac{SP} is random
then it can simulate from a family of distributions. In addition to simulating,
a random \ac{SP} may be able to report the log-density of an output given an input.
Different \ac{SP}s are used to construct the \ac{GP} interface:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item MakeGPOutputSP is a deterministic \ac{SP} whose output is a
    \ac{GP}-sampler, namely the GPSP, given a covariance and a mean function as input. 
\item GPSP of is type SP\@. GPSP is responsible for tracking the sufficient statistics
from the applications of GPSP and for evaluating the log density of all those
applications as a block.
\item GPOutputPSP of type Random PSP\@.  It is this SP that actually samples
regression output at given input.
\end{enumerate}


%procedures that return other stochastic procedures and implement this optimization are said to be
%absorbing at applications, often abbreviated AAA.
