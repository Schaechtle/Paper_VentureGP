% Who is a candidate reader?
%   I would say that there are two candidate readers. 
%     1. an ML person with background in nonparametrics. This reader does not care
%     about implementation (but she should!). We need to convince her that SPs are
%     a good way to think of GPs 
%     2. people with prob prog background that before reading our paper,
%     did not care about GPs
% 
% What is the idea that they are supposed to gain?
%   The idea that they are supposed to gain is that SPs as the basic units of
%   computation in Venture are good way to talk and think about GPs. 
% 
% There were too many irrelevant concepts at once.
%   I tried to divide what was there into relevant and irrelevant.
%   Relevant:
%     SP
%     GPSP
%     GPout(P)SP
%     MakeOutput(P)SP
%   Irrelevant:
%     AAA
%     PSP 
%     GPSPAux/Aux
% 
% Decision: I removed the PSP here - resulting in the description being somewhat
% unfaithful the implementation because GPoutPSP will be described as GPoutSP.
% PSP being  a kind of SP, I think that we are still telling a version of
% the truth. 
% 
% Issues:
%   - first paragraph is too assertive
%   - transition from first to second paragraph is not smooth

Smoothly integrating Gaussian processes into a probabilistic
programming system calls for several facilities.  One natural
embedding of a \ac{GP} is as a higher-order stochastic function that
accepts the mean and covariance kernel functions and returns a
function from inputs to outputs:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    assume gp = make_gp(mu, K);
    // Jointly sample values for the inputs 3, 4, 5
    predict gp(3);
    predict gp(4);
    predict gp(5);
    \end{lstlisting}

The different invocations of \texttt{gp} above are not independent
(unless \texttt{K} gives zero covariance for those pairs of inputs),
though they are exchangeable.  Furthermore, it is not possible to
construct a finite object conditioned on which all future invocations
of \texttt{gp} become independent, as it would need to contain an
infinite amount of information.  Consequently, those applications need
to refer to some shared state that is updated in response to
applications appearing (and, if they occur in conditional control
branches, disappearing).

In addition to sampling, the \ac{GP} library must also expose the
ability to report the probability density function of any given
application of \texttt{gp} (conditioned on the results of all the
others).  Finally, since they have to maintain sufficient statistics
to implement coupling anyway, it makes sense to expose to the runtime
system the ability to evaluate the joint probability density of all
extant applications of \texttt{gp} without having to query each
individually, for example for doing inference on (the parameters of)
the covariance kernel.

We wanted to take advantage of optimized linear algebra subroutines
for the covariance matrix manipulations, so we implemented the
Gaussian process for Venture as a (higher-order) foreign \ac{SP}.
Our \ac{GP} implementation thus exercises all the major components of
the Venture \ac{SP} interface:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \texttt{make\_gp} is an \ac{SP} that accepts a representation
  of the mean and covariance kernels and returns a freshly
  made \texttt{gp} procedure.

  \item a given made \texttt{gp} is another, foreign \ac{SP} that
  is to accept an input point and return the value of the \ac{GP} at that
  point.  In detail:

  \item When a \texttt{gp} is created, Venture invokes
  its \texttt{constructSPAux} method (``aux'' for ``auxiliary
  information''), which creates an (initially empty) store of seen
  applications of that \ac{GP}.

  \item Venture uses the \texttt{simulate} and \texttt{logDensity}
  methods of the \texttt{gp} \ac{SP} to sample from or evaluate the
  probability density function of the Gaussian distribution that
  describes the value of the \ac{GP} at that input point.  These
  distributions are conditioned on other extant applications of
  the \texttt{gp} because the \texttt{simulate}
  and \texttt{logDensity} methods have access to the auxiliary store
  of seen input-output pairs.

  \item When applications of \texttt{gp} are created (resp.\
  destroyed), Venture invokes that \ac{SP}'s \texttt{incorporate}
  (resp.\ \texttt{unincorporate}) method with the input-output pair.
  For a \texttt{gp}, that adds (resp.\ removes) that point from
  the auxiliary store.

  \item \texttt{gp} sets a flag that indicates to Venture that it can
  evaluate the joint probability density of all extant applications of
  itself by examining its auxiliary store.  Therefore, when Venture
  evaluates proposals to, for example, the parameters of a \ac{GP}
  covariance kernel, it can compute that \ac{GP}'s applications'
  contribution to any relevant acceptance ratios by invoking
  the \texttt{logDensityOfCounts} method, instead of
  calling \texttt{logDensity} for each application separately.

  \item The \ac{GP} implementation supports gradient inference methods
  (gradient optimization, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, etc.) by defining
  the \texttt{gradientOfLogDensityOfCounts} method appropriately.

\end{itemize}

% TODO:

% - Do we want a citation at the end to something that explains
%   Venture's architecture in more detail, so that the reader can
%   choose to figure out what happens on the Venture side, in between
%   all those method calls?

% - Related: Do we want to reassure a hypothetical savvy reader that
%   Venture does a valid interleaving of unincorporate, logDensity,
%   incorporate, logDensity for proposals that touch multiple
%   exchangeably coupled applications?  The previous exposition
%   glosses over this.

% - The previous exposition also glosses over the SP/PSP distinction
%   (which I do not view as essential anyway), and the detail that
%   the childrenCanAAA flag is actually on make_gp rather than gp.

% - The exposition also glosses over details of the automatic
%   differentiation system, as well as the limitation that the
%   covariance functions have to be foreign to Venture as well
%   (and the completely baroque reason why!)

In the rest of the paper, we do not use \texttt{make\_gp} directly,
but wrap it in the generalizing memoizer \texttt{gpmem}, introduced in
the next section.  As far as implementation in Venture goes, it
suffices to arrange for the \texttt{f\_compute} that \texttt{gpmem}
returns to insert computed input-output pairs into the auxiliary store
constructed for the \texttt{f\_emu} that \texttt{gpmem} also returns.
