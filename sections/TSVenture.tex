Because Venture supports sampling and inference on (stochastic-)procedure-valued random variables (and the generative models which produce those procedures), Venture can capture arbitrary context spaces as described above.
To demonstrate, we have implemented Thompson sampling in Venture in which the contexts $\theta$ are Gaussian processes over the action space $\Acal = \R$.
That is, $\theta = (\mu, K)$, where the mean $\mu$ is a computable function $\Acal \to \R$ and the covariance $K$ is a computable (symmetric, positive-semidefinite) function $\Acal \times \Acal \to \R$.
This represents a Gaussian process $\br{R_a}_{a \in \Acal}$, where $R_a$ represents the reward for action $a$.
% where for any finite subset $\br{a_i}_{i=1}^{n} \subset \Acal$, the marginal distribution on $\pn{R_{a_i}}$ is Gaussian with mean $\pn{\mu(a_i)}_{i=1}^{n}$ and covariance matrix $\begin{pmatrix} K(a_i,a_j) \end{pmatrix}_{1 \leq i,j \leq n}$.
Computationally, we represent a context not as a pair of infinite lookup tables for $\mu$ and $K$, but as a finite data structure $\theta = (K_\prior, \sigma, \ell, \abf_\past, \rbf_\past)$, where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $K_\prior = K_{\prior,\sigma,\ell}$ is a procedure, with parameters $\sigma,\ell$, to be used as the prior covariance function: $K_\prior(a,a') = \sigma^2 \exp\pn{-\frac{(a-a')^2}{2\ell^2}}$
  \item $\sigma$ and $\ell$ are (hyper)parameters for $K_\prior$
  \item $\abf_\past = \pn{a_i}_{i=1}^{n}$ are the previously probed actions
  \item $\rbf_\past = \pn{r_i}_{i=1}^{n}$ are the corresponding rewards
\end{itemize}
To simplify the treatment, we take prior mean $\mu_\prior \equiv 0$.  The mean and covariance for $\theta$ are then gotten by the usual conditioning formula:
\begin{align*}
  \mu(\abf)
  &= \mu\pn{\abf \mvert \abf_\past, \rbf_\past} \\
  &= K_\prior(\abf, \abf_\past)
     \,K_\prior(\abf_\past, \abf_\past)^{-1}
     \,\rbf_\past \\
  K(\abf, \abf)
  &= K\pn{\abf, \abf \mvert \abf_\past, \rbf_\past} \\
  &= K_\prior(\abf, \abf)
     - K_\prior(\abf, \abf_\past)
       \,K_\prior(\abf_\past, \abf_\past)^{-1}
       \,K_\prior(\abf_\past, \abf).
\end{align*}
Note that even in this simple example, the context space $\Theta$ is not a finite-dimensional parametric family, since the vectors $\abf_\past$ and $\rbf_\past$ grow as more samples are taken.
$\Theta$ is, however, quite easily representable as a computational procedure together with parameters and past samples, as we do in the representation $\theta = (K_\prior, \sigma, \ell, \abf_\past, \rbf_\past)$.
