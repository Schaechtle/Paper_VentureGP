Inductive learning of symbolic expression for continuous-valued time series
data is a hard task which has recently been tackled using a greedy search over 
the approximate posterior of the possible kernel compostions for
\ac{GP}s~\citep{duvenaud2013structure,lloyd2014automatic}\footnote{\url{http://www.automaticstatistician.com/}}.

With \gpmem\ we can provide a fully Bayesian treatment of this, previously unavaible,
using a stochastic grammar  (see Fig. \ref{fig:schema}).
The stochastic grammar samples kernels that are parametrized and then fed into
\gpmem\ (see Fig. \ref{fig:schema}, (a)) which generates an emulator. 
The emulator generated by \gpmem\ observes unstructured time series data. 
The aim here is to find a kernel structure (Fig. \ref{fig:schema} (b)), that is 
compositions of different base kernels (Fig. \ref{fig:schema} (c)).

\caption{(a) Graphical description of Bayesian GP structure learning. A stochastic grammar generates samples of kernels that are used as input for \gpmem. Hyper-parameters are sampled accordingly, that is, as needed for a
certain structure. We observe value pairs of unstructured time series data on the bottom of the schematic. We can also generate predictions for future points in time. (b) An example of composite kernel structure. We use addition and multiplication to combine base kernels.
Base kernels and compositional kernels are shown in (c) alongside the natural language interpretation of the structure.}\label{fig:schema}
\end{figure}
The stochastic grammar models a prior on different structural compositions of the covariance function. An input of non-composite kernels (base kernels) is supplied to generate a posterior distributions of composite structure to express local and global aspects of the data.


We approximate the following intractable integrals of the expectation for the prediction:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[\hat{f} \mid \hat{x},\mathbf{D},\mathbf{K}] =\iint f(\hat{x},\bm{\theta},\mathbf{K})\,P(\bm{\theta} \mid \mathbf{D,\mathbf{K}})\,P(\mathbf{K}|\bm{\Omega},s,n) \; \mathbf{d} \bm{\theta} \mathbf{d} \mathbf{K}.  
\end{equation}

This is done by sampling from the posterior probability distribution of the hyper-parameters and the possible kernel:
\begin{equation}
\hat{f} \approx \frac{1}{T} \sum^T_{t=1} f(\hat{x} | \bm{\theta}^{(t)},\mathbf{K}^{(t)}). 
\end{equation}


In order to provide the sampling of the kernel, we introduce a stochastic process that simulates the grammar for algebraic expressions of covariance function algebra:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{K}^{(t)} \sim  P(\mathbf{K} \mid \bm{\Omega},s,n)
\end{equation}
Here, we start with the set of given base kernels and draw a random subset.
For this subset of size $n$, we sample a set of possible operators $\bm{\Omega}$ combining base kernels. 
The marginal probability of a composite structure
\begin{equation}
P(\mathbf{K} \mid \bm{\Omega},s,n) = P(\bm{\Omega} \mid s,n)\times P(s \mid n) \times P(n),
\end{equation}
is characterized by the prior $P(n)$ on the number of base kernels used, the probability of a uniformly chosen subset of the set of $n$ possible covariance functions
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:subsets}
P(s \mid n) = \frac{n!}{ \mid s \mid !},
\end{equation}
and the probability of sampling a global or a local structure, which is given by a binomial distribution: 
\begin{equation}
P(\bm{\Omega} \mid s,n)= {n \choose r}  p_{+\times}^r (1 - p_{+\times})^{n-r}.
\end{equation}



Many equivalent covariance structures can be sampled due to covariance function algebra
and equivalent representations with different parameterization~\citep{lloyd2014automatic}.
To inspect the posterior of these equivalent structures we convert each kernel expression
into a sum of products and subsequently simplify. All base kernels can be found in Appendix A,
rules for this simplification can be found in appendix B. The code for learning of kernel structure 
is as follows:

\input{code/code_venstructure.tex}

We defined a simple space of covariance structures in a way that allows us to produce results coherent with 
work presented in Automatic Statistician. We illustrate results in Fig. \ref{fig:posterior} and \ref{fig:posterior_airline} using the Mauna Loa  CO$_2$ data set (see \citealp{rasmussen2006gaussian} for a description) and the airline data set describing monthly totals of international airline passengers (\citealp{box2011time}, according to \citealp{duvenaud2013structure}). Both datasets served as illustrations in the Automatic Statistician project. Previous work on automated kernel discovery~\citep{duvenaud2013structure} illustrated the Mauna Loa data using an RQ kernel.
We resort to the white noise kernel instead of RQ (similar to \citep{lloyd2014automatic}).

In contrast to what previous work has presented, we compute a posterior on structures. This allows us to gain valuable insight into the data that was previously unavailable. 
We can query the data for the probability of certain structures to hold true. For example, we could be interested in whether or not a trend is present in the data.
We can also formulate queries using logical operators such as AND and OR. This provides us with a rich language to ask questions about our time series data and let the data speak for itself for finding the answers. We demonstrate this in Fig \ref{fig:query}.
