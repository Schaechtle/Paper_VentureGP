The space of possible kernel composition is infinite. Combining inference over this space with the problem of finding a good parameterization that could potentially explain the observed data best poses a hard problem. The natural language interpretation of the meaning of a kernel and it's composition renders this a problem of symbolic computation. Duvenaud and colleagues note that a sum of kernels can be interpreted as logical OR operations and kernel multiplication as logical AND~\citeyearpar{duvenaud2013structure}. This is due to the kernel rendering two points similar if $k_1$ OR $k_2$ outputs a high value in the case of a sum. Respectively, multiplication of two kernels results in high values only if $k_1$ AND $k_2$ have high values (see Fig. \ref{fig:composite} examplifies how to interpret global vs. local aspects and its symbolic analog respectively). 
In the following, we will refer to covariance functions that are not composite as base covariance functions.

\caption{Composition of covariance function parsed using the example SE $\times$ LIN $+$ PER $\times$ LIN $+$  RQ $\times$ LIN}\label{fig:composite}
\end{figure}


Knowledge about the composite nature of covariance functions is not new, however, until recently, the choice and the composition of covariance functions were done ad-hoc. The Automated Statistician Project came up with an approximate search over the possible space of kernel structures~\citep{duvenaud2013structure,lloyd2014automatic}. However, a fully Bayesian treatment of this was not done before.
The case where the covariance structure is not given is even more interesting. Our probabilistic programming based MCMC framework approximates the following intractable integrals of the expectation for the prediction:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[y^* \mid x^*,\mathbf{D},\mathbf{K}] =\iint f(x^*,\bm{\theta},\mathbf{K})\,P(\bm{\theta} \mid \mathbf{D,\mathbf{K}})\,P(\mathbf{K}|\bm{\Omega},s,n) \; \mathbf{d} \bm{\theta} \mathbf{d} \mathbf{K}.  
\end{equation}
This is done by sampling from the posterior probability distribution of the hyper-parameters and the possible kernel:
\begin{equation}
y^* \approx \frac{1}{T} \sum^T_{t=1} f(x^* | \bm{\theta}^{(t)},\mathbf{K}^{(t)}). 
\end{equation}


In order to provide the sampling of the kernel, we introduce a stochastic process to the SP that simulates the grammar for algebraic expressions of covariance function algebra:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{K}^{(t)} \sim  P(\mathbf{K} \mid \bm{\Omega},s,n)
\end{equation}
Here, we start with a set of possible kernels and draw a random subset. For this subset of size $n$, we sample a set of possible operators that operate on the base kernels. 

The marginal probability of a kernel structure which allows us to sample  is characterized by the probability of a uniformly chosen subset of the set of $n$ possible covariance functions times the probability of sampling a global or a local structure which is given by a binomial distribution: 

\begin{equation}
P(\mathbf{K} \mid \bm{\Omega},s,n) = P(\bm{\Omega} \mid s,n)\times P(s \mid n) \times P(n),
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
P(\bm{\Omega} \mid s,n)= {n \choose r}  p_{+\times}^k (1 - p_{+\times})^{n-k}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:subsets}
P(s \mid n) = \frac{n!}{ \mid s \mid !}
\end{equation}
where $P(n)$ is a prior on the number of base kernels used which can sample from a discrete uniform distribution. This will strongly prefer simple covariance structures with few base kernels since individual base kernels are more likely to be sampled in this case due to (\ref{eq:subsets}). Alternatively, we can approximate a uniform prior over structures by weighting $P(n)$ towards higher numbers. It is possible to also assign a prior for the probability to sample global or local structures, however, we have assigned complete uncertainty to this with the probability of a flip $p = 0.5$.



Many equivalent covariance structures can be sampled due to covariance function algebra and equivalent representations with different parameterization~\citep{lloyd2014automatic}. Certain covariance functions can differ in terms of the hyper-parameterization but can be absorbed into a single covariance function with a different parameterization. To inspect the posterior of these equivalent structures we convert each kernel expression into a sum of products and subsequently simplify. Rules for this simplification can be found in appendix B.


For reproducing results from the Automated Statistician Project in a Bayesian fashion we first define a prior on the hypothesis space. Note that, as in the implementation of the Automated Statistician, we upper-bound the complexity of the space of covariance functions we want to explore. We also put vague priors on hyper-parameters.

We defined the space of covariance structures in a way allowing us to reproduce results for covariance function structure learning as in the Automated Statistician. This lead to coherent results, for example for the airline data set describing monthly totals of international airline passengers (\citealp{box2011time}, according to \citealp{duvenaud2013structure}. We will elaborate the result using a sample from the posterior (Fig. \ref{fig:tutorial}). The sample is identical with the highest scoring result reported in previous work using a search-and-score method~\citep{duvenaud2013structure} for the CO$_2$ data set (see \citealp{rasmussen2006gaussian} for a description) and the predictive capability is comparable. However, the components factor in a different way due to different parameterization of the individual base kernels.

We further investigated the quality of our stochastic processes by running a leave one out cross-validation to gain confidence on the posterior. This resulted in 545 independent runs of the Markov chain that produced a coherent posterior: our Bayesian interpretation of GP structure and GPs produced a posterior of structures that is in line with previous results on this data set (~\citealp*{duvenaud2013structure}; see Fig. \ref{fig:structureCo2}).

We ran similar evaluation on the airline data set resulting in a similar structure to what was previously reporte (Fig. \ref{fig:structureAir}, residuals and log-score along the Markov chain see Fig. \ref{fig:reslog}).

We found the final sample of multiple runs to be most informative. This kind of Markov Chain seems to produce samples that are highly auto-correlated.

Given two additive components $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{K_a} + \mathbf{K_b}$, one can compute the margninal of a global component of a composite kernel structure~\citep{benavoli2015gaussian} with a gaussian posterior $\mathcal{N}(f_a \mid \hat{\mu}_a,\hat{\mathbf{K}}_a)$  where:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:marginalComponentMean}
\hat{\bm\mu}_a   = \mathbf{K_a}(\xbf,\xbf^*)\, \mathbf{K}(\xbf^*,\xbf^*)^{-1}\, \ybf
\end{equation}
and covariance matrix
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:marginalComponentCovariance}
\hat{\mathbf{K}}_a =   \mathbf{K_a}(\xbf,\xbf) -  \mathbf{K_a}(\xbf,\xbf^*)\mathbf{K}(\xbf^*,\xbf^*)^{-1} \mathbf{K_a}(\xbf^*,\xbf).
\end{equation}
