\subsection{Statistical Memoizers}
We now introduce a language construct for probabilistic programming called a
\emph{statistical memoizer}.  In addition to providing an elegant linguistic
framework for function learning--related tasks such as Bayesian optimization,
the statistical memoizer highlights shortcomings of the notations currently used
in statistics, and how language constructs from programming allow the expression
of models which would be cumbersome (prohibitively so, in some cases) to express
in statistics notation.

Suppose we have a function $\ftt$ which can be evaluated, but as in Section
\ref{sec:bayesopt-intro}, we wish to learn about the behavior of $\ftt$ using as
few evaluations as possible.  The statistical memoizer, which here we give the
name $\mm$, was motivated by this purpose.  It produces two outputs:
\[ \ftt \xrightarrow{\mm} (\ftt_\probe, \ftt_\emu). \]
The function $\ftt_\probe$ calls $\ftt$ and stores the output in a memo
table, just as traditional memoization does.  The function $\ftt_\emu$ is
an online statistical emulator which uses the memo table as its training
data.  A fully Bayesian emulator, modelling the true function $\ftt$ as a
random function $f \sim P(f)$, would satisfy
\[
\texttt{(}\ftt_\emu\ \xtt_1\ \ldots\ \xtt_k\texttt{)}
\sim
P\pn{
  f(\xtt_1), \ldots, f(\xtt_k)
  \mvert
  \text{$f(\xtt) = \texttt{(f x)}$ for each $\xtt$ in memo table}
}.
\]
Non-Bayesian emulators are possible as well, but here we will focus on the
Bayesian case.  Different implementations of the statistical memoizer can have
different prior distributions $P(f)$; our main example is a Gaussian process
prior (implemented as \texttt{gpmem} below).  Note that we require the ability
to sample $\ftt_\emu$ jointly at multiple inputs because the values of
$f(\xtt_1),\ldots,f(\xtt_k)$ will in general be dependent.

To illustrate the linguistic power of $\mm$, consider a simple model program
that uses $\mm$, procedure abstraction, and a loop:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,escapechar=\#,numbers=left,numbersep=5pt,numberstyle=\tiny\color{gray}]
(define (choose_next_point em)
  (gridsearch_argmax em))
(define (extract_answer em)
  ;; Here (stats em) is the memo table {(x_i, y_i)}.
  ;; Take the (x,y) pair with the largest y.
  (first (max (stats em) second)))
(assume theta (tag 'params #{\it $\langle$parameters for the statistical emulator$\rangle$}#))

(assume_list (f_probe f_emu) (mem&em f theta))
(let loop ((count 15))
  (if (= count 0)
    (extract_answer f_emu)
    (begin
      (f_probe (choose_next_point f_emu)) #\label{ln:mem&em-penultimate}#
      (loop (- count 1)))))
\end{lstlisting}
This program is written in a Venture-flavored pseudocode language that we call
``pseudo-Venture.''  Most of the code we present, including Figure
\ref{fig:slide3-definitions} and Listings \ref{lst:gp-uniform},
\ref{lst:quad-bayesopt}, and \ref{lst:drift}, will be in pseudo-Venture in order
to simplify the presentation.  The runnable Venture code is essentially the
same, except for some rough edges of syntax and other inessential complications;
see Appendix \ref{app:attachments} for more information.

An equivalent model in typical statistics notation, written in a way that
attempts to be as linguistically faithful as possible, is
\begin{align*}
  \s{0}f &\sim P(f) \\
  \s{t}\xtt &= \argmax_x \s{t}f(x) \\
  \s{t+1}f &\sim P\pn{\s{t}f \mvert \s{t}f(\s{t}\xtt) = \texttt(\ftt\ \s{t}\xtt\texttt)}.
\end{align*}
We highlight two points:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The linguistic constructs for abstraction are not present in
    statistics notation.  The equation $\s{t}\xtt = \argmax_x \s{t}f(x)$
    has to be inlined in statistics notation: while something like
    \[ \s{t}\xtt \sim F(\s{t}P) \]
    (where $\s{t}P$ is a probability measure, and $F$ here plays the role of
    \texttt{choose\_next\_point}) is mathematically coherent, it is not what
    statisticians would ordinarily write.  This lack of abstraction then makes
    modularity, or the easy digestion of large but finely decomposable models,
    more difficult in statistics notation.

  \item Adding a single line to the program, such as
    \begin{lstlisting}
    (infer (mh 'params one 50))
    \end{lstlisting}
    after line \ref{ln:mem&em-penultimate} to infer the parameters of the
    emulator\footnote{
      The definition of these parameters depends on the particular
      implementation of $\mm$, and could for example be the hyperparameters
      of the covariance function of a GP.
    }, would require a significant refactoring and elaboration of the statistics
    notation.  One basic reason is that probabilistic programs are written
    procedurally, whereas statistical notation is declarative; reasoning
    declaratively about the dynamics of a fundamentally procedural inference
    algorithm is often unwieldy due to the absence of programming constructs
    such as loops and mutable state.
\end{enumerate}
